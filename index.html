      <p class="description"> Before 14th century, a small village existed in the place of today's Brăila, probably inhabited by fishermen and small merchants.The village fell to the Mongols during the 1241.
        The first certain document mentioning Brăila is a privilege act, given by Vladislav I of Wallachia to German merchants of Brașov, who were exempt of customs duties when they followed the road from Brașov to the Danube.
        Around 1540, the city became a part of the Ottoman Empire. The town was part of the Empire's northern defensive network and the Ottomans built a stone stronghold in the town.The Ottomans called it Ibrail or Ibraila.
        During the 19th century, the port became one of the three most important ports on the Danube. The city's greatest period of prosperity was at the end of the 19th century and in the early 20th century, when it was an
        important port for most of the merchandise coming in and going out of Romania. During World War II, Brăila was captured in 1944 by Soviet troops. After the 1989 Revolution, Brăila entered a period of economic decline.
